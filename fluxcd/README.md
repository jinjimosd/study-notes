## 1️⃣ Introduction
Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux v2 is constructed with the GitOps Toolkit, a set of composable APIs and specialized tools for building Continuous Delivery on top of Kubernetes.

## 2️⃣ GitOps Toolkit
The GitOps Toolkit is the set of APIs and controllers that make up the runtime for Flux v2.

The APIs comprise Kubernetes custom resources, which can be created and updated by a cluster user, or by other automation tooling.

## 3️⃣ Core Concepts
### GitOps
GitOps is a way of managing your infrastructure and applications that: 
- Whole system is described declaratively and version controlled (most likely in a Git repository).
- Having an automated process that ensures that the deployed environment matches the state specified in a repository.

### Sources
A Source defines the origin of a repository containing the desired state of the system and the requirements to obtain it.

Sources produce an artifact that is consumed by other Flux components to perform actions, like applying the contents of the artifact on the cluster.

A source may be shared by multiple consumers to deduplicate configuration.

The origin of the source is checked for changes on a defined interval, if there is a newer version available that matches the criteria, a new artifact is produced.

<img height=500px src="resources/images/3_source-controller.png" alt="source-controller"></a>

All sources are specified as Custom Resources in a Kubernetes cluster, examples of sources are GitRepository, OCIRepository, HelmRepository and Bucket resources.

### Reconciliation
Reconciliation refers to ensuring that a given state (e.g. application running in the cluster, infrastructure) matches a desired state declaratively defined somewhere (e.g. a Git repository).
There are various examples of these in Flux:
- `HelmRelease` reconciliation: ensures the state of the Helm release matches what is defined in the resource.
- `Bucket` reconciliation: downloads and archives the contents of the declared bucket on a given interval and stores this as an artifact.
- `Kustomization` reconciliation: ensures the state of the application deployed on a cluster matches the resources defined in a Git or OCI repository or S3 bucket.

### Kustomization
It is a local set of Kubernetes resources (e.g. kustomize overlay) that Flux is supposed to reconcile in the cluster.

The reconciliation runs every five minutes by default, but this can be changed with .spec.interval.

If you make any changes to the cluster using kubectl edit/patch/delete, they will be promptly reverted. You either suspend the reconciliation or push your changes to a Git repository.

### Bootstrap
The process of installing the Flux components in a GitOps manner is called a bootstrap.
- The manifests are applied to the cluster.
- A GitRepository and Kustomization are created for the Flux components.
- The manifests are pushed to an existing Git repository (or a new one is created)

Flux can manage itself just as it manages other resources.

### Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery refers to the practice of delivering software updates frequently and reliably.

### Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production once they have passed through automated testing.

### Progressive Delivery
It builds on Continuous Delivery by gradually rolling out new features or updates to a subset of users, allowing developers to test and monitor the new features in a controlled environment and make necessary adjustments before releasing them to everyone.

Developers can use techniques like feature flags, canary releases, and A/B testing to minimize the chances of introducing bugs or errors that could harm users or interrupt business operations. 

The Flux project offers a specialised controller called Flagger that implements various progressive delivery techniques.

## 4️⃣ Quick start in local env
### Install kubernetes
I used Kind to install Kubernetes with 1 master and 2 workers.
```
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.20.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
kind create cluster --name cluster01 --config resources/kind/cluster-demo.yaml
kubectl create -f resources/kind/tigera-operator.yaml
kubectl create -f resources/kind/calico.yaml
kubectl apply -f resources/kind/nginx-ingress-deploy.yaml
```

### Install kustomize
```
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/master/hack/install_kustomize.sh"  | bash
sudo mv kustomize /usr/local/bin/
echo 'source <(kustomize completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Create GitLab personal access token
Generate a personal access token that grants complete read/write access to the GitLab API.
```
export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### Run flux bootstrap
```
flux bootstrap gitlab \
  --owner=<gitlab-username> \
  --repository=fleet-infra \
  --branch=master \
  --path=clusters/cluster01 \
  --token-auth \
  --personal
```

### Clone the git repository
Clone the fleet-infra repository to your local machine:
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/fluxcd
cd ~/workspace/fluxcd
git clone git@gitlab.com:<username>/fleet-infra.git
cd fleet-infra
```

### Add podinfo repository to Flux
This example uses a public repository [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo), a tiny web application made with Go.
- Create a GitRepository manifest pointing to podinfo repository’s master branch:
```
flux create source git podinfo \
  --url=https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo \
  --branch=master \
  --interval=30s \
  --export > ./clusters/cluster01/podinfo-source.yaml
git add -A && git commit -m "Add podinfo GitRepository"
git push
```
- Check logs of pod source-controller, you will see:
```
{"level":"info","ts":"2023-07-04T10:29:55.043Z","msg":"stored artifact for commit 'Add podinfo GitRepository'","controller":"gitrepository","controllerGroup":"source.toolkit.fluxcd.io","controllerKind":"GitRepository","GitRepository":{"name":"flux-system","namespace":"flux-system"},"namespace":"flux-system","name":"flux-system","reconcileID":"3a127e3e-23e2-4035-91fb-914bd61bcb68"}

{"level":"info","ts":"2023-07-04T10:29:58.851Z","msg":"stored artifact for commit 'Merge pull request #274 from stefanprodan/alpine-3...'","controller":"gitrepository","controllerGroup":"source.toolkit.fluxcd.io","controllerKind":"GitRepository","GitRepository":{"name":"podinfo","namespace":"flux-system"},"namespace":"flux-system","name":"podinfo","reconcileID":"0af3d8ba-b00c-4999-be09-1ab249bb72c5"}
```
- In the source-controller, we will see:

<img src="resources/images/4_create_sources.png" alt="create_sources"></a>

### Deploy podinfo application
Configure Flux to build and apply the `kustomize` directory located in the podinfo repository.
- Use the `flux create` command to create a `Kustomization` that applies the podinfo deployment.
```
flux create kustomization podinfo \
  --target-namespace=default \
  --source=podinfo \
  --path="./kustomize" \
  --prune=true \
  --interval=5m \
  --export > ./clusters/cluster01/podinfo-kustomization.yaml
git add -A && git commit -m "Add podinfo Kustomization"
git push
```

### Watch Flux sync the application 
- Use the flux get command to watch the podinfo app.
```
flux get kustomizations --watch
```
- Check podinfo has been deployed on your cluster:
```
kubectl -n default get deployments,services
```


### Suspend updates
- To suspend updates for a kustomization, run the command `flux suspend kustomization <name>`
- To resume updates run the command `flux resume kustomization <name>`

### Customize podinfo deployment
To customize a deployment from a repository you don’t control, you can use [Flux in-line patches](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#patches). Example:
- Add the following to the field spec of your podinfo-kustomization.yaml file:
```
  patches:
    - patch: |-
        apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
        kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
        metadata:
          name: podinfo
        spec:
          minReplicas: 3             
      target:
        name: podinfo
        kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
```
- Commit and push the podinfo-kustomization.yaml changes:
```
git add -A && git commit -m "Increase podinfo minimum replicas"
git push
```
- After the synchronization finishes, running kubectl get pods should display 3 pods.

## 5️⃣ Ways of structuring your repositories
### Monorepo
In a monorepo approach you would store all your Kubernetes manifests in a single Git repository.

The various environments specific configs are all stored in the same branch (e.g. `main`).

A complete example of this approach can be found at [flux2-kustomize-helm-example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example).

### Repo per environment
This approach is similar to the monorepo, with some notable differences:
- You can grant access to a subset of team members while allowing everyone to clone staging and open pull requests.
- Promoting changes from one environment to another can be more time-consuming especially for infrastructure changes that can’t be automated with Flux image updates.

### Repo per team 
Assuming your organization has a dedicated platform admin team that provides Kubernetes as-a-service for other teams.

The platform admin team is responsible for:
- Setting up the staging and production environments.
- Maintains the cluster addon-ons and other cluster-wide resources (CRDs, controllers, admission webhooks, etc).
- Onboards the dev teams repositories using Flux’s `GitRepository` custom resources.
- Configures how the dev teams repositories are reconciled on each cluster using Flux’s `Kustomization` custom resources.

The dev teams are responsible for:
- Setting up the apps definitions (Kubernetes deployments, Helm releases).
- Configures how the apps are reconciled on each environment (Kustomize overlays, Helm values).
- Manages the apps promotion between environments using Flux’s automated image updates to Git.

Repository structure:
- Platform admin repository example (kustomize overlays):
```
├── teams
│   ├── team1
│   ├── team2
├── infrastructure
│   ├── base
│   ├── production 
│   └── staging
└── clusters
    ├── production
    └── staging
```
- Dev team repository example (kustomize overlays):
```
└── apps
    ├── base
    ├── production 
    └── staging
```
- A complete example of this approach can be found at [flux2-multi-tenancy](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-multi-tenancy).

Delivery:
- The delivery process is similar to the monorepo one. 
- The main difference is the separation of concerns, the platform admin team handles the change management of the infrastructure, but delegates the apps delivery to the dev teams.

### Repo per app
It is common to use the same repository to store both the application source code and its deployment manifests.

The config repo can hold a pointer to the app manifests.

Repository structure:
- App repository plain Kubernetes manifests example:
```
├── src
└── deploy
    └── manifests
```
- Delivery example (stored in config repo):
```
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  url: https://<host>/<org>/app
  ref:
    semver: "1.x"
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: app
  path: ./deploy/manifests
  patchesStrategicMerge:
    - apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: app
      spec:
        replicas: 2
```
- App repository Kustomize overlays example:
```
├── src
└── deploy
    ├── base
    ├── production 
    └── staging
```
- Delivery example (stored in config repo):
```
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  url: https://<host>/<org>/app
  ref:
    branch: main
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: app
  path: ./deploy/production
```
- App repository Helm chart example:
```
├── src
└── chart
    ├── templates
    ├── values.yaml 
    └── values-prod.yaml
```
- Delivery example (stored in config repo):
```
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: apps
spec:
  url: https://<host>/<org>/charts
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: app
      version: "1.x"
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: apps
  values:
    replicas: 2
```
