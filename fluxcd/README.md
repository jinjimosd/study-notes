## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction
Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of configuration (like Git repositories and OCI artifacts), and automating updates to configuration when there is new code to deploy.

Flux v2 is constructed with the GitOps Toolkit, a set of composable APIs and specialized tools for building Continuous Delivery on top of Kubernetes.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ GitOps Toolkit
The GitOps Toolkit is the set of APIs and controllers that make up the runtime for Flux v2.

The APIs comprise Kubernetes custom resources, which can be created and updated by a cluster user, or by other automation tooling.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Core Concepts
### GitOps
GitOps is a way of managing your infrastructure and applications that: 
- Whole system is described declaratively and version controlled (most likely in a Git repository).
- Having an automated process that ensures that the deployed environment matches the state specified in a repository.

### Sources
A Source defines the origin of a repository containing the desired state of the system and the requirements to obtain it.

Sources produce an artifact that is consumed by other Flux components to perform actions, like applying the contents of the artifact on the cluster.

A source may be shared by multiple consumers to deduplicate configuration.

The origin of the source is checked for changes on a defined interval, if there is a newer version available that matches the criteria, a new artifact is produced.

<img height=500px src="resources/images/3_source-controller.png" alt="source-controller"></a>

All sources are specified as Custom Resources in a Kubernetes cluster, examples of sources are GitRepository, OCIRepository, HelmRepository and Bucket resources.

### Reconciliation
Reconciliation refers to ensuring that a given state (e.g. application running in the cluster, infrastructure) matches a desired state declaratively defined somewhere (e.g. a Git repository).
There are various examples of these in Flux:
- `HelmRelease` reconciliation: ensures the state of the Helm release matches what is defined in the resource.
- `Bucket` reconciliation: downloads and archives the contents of the declared bucket on a given interval and stores this as an artifact.
- `Kustomization` reconciliation: ensures the state of the application deployed on a cluster matches the resources defined in a Git or OCI repository or S3 bucket.

### Kustomization
It is a local set of Kubernetes resources (e.g. kustomize overlay) that Flux is supposed to reconcile in the cluster.

The reconciliation runs every five minutes by default, but this can be changed with .spec.interval.

If you make any changes to the cluster using kubectl edit/patch/delete, they will be promptly reverted. You either suspend the reconciliation or push your changes to a Git repository.

### Bootstrap
The process of installing the Flux components in a GitOps manner is called a bootstrap.
- The manifests are applied to the cluster.
- A GitRepository and Kustomization are created for the Flux components.
- The manifests are pushed to an existing Git repository (or a new one is created)

Flux can manage itself just as it manages other resources.

### Continuous Delivery
Continuous Delivery refers to the practice of delivering software updates frequently and reliably.

### Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production once they have passed through automated testing.

### Progressive Delivery
It builds on Continuous Delivery by gradually rolling out new features or updates to a subset of users, allowing developers to test and monitor the new features in a controlled environment and make necessary adjustments before releasing them to everyone.

Developers can use techniques like feature flags, canary releases, and A/B testing to minimize the chances of introducing bugs or errors that could harm users or interrupt business operations. 

The Flux project offers a specialised controller called Flagger that implements various progressive delivery techniques.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Quick start in local env
### Install kubernetes
I used Kind to install Kubernetes with 1 master and 2 workers.
```
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.20.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
kind create cluster --name cluster01 --config resources/kind/cluster-ha-demo.yaml
kubectl create -f resources/kind/tigera-operator.yaml
kubectl create -f resources/kind/calico.yaml
kubectl apply -f resources/kind/nginx-ingress-deploy.yaml
bash resources/kind/HAProxy.sh
```

### Create GitLab personal access token
Generate a personal access token that grants complete read/write access to the GitLab API.

<img src="resources/images/4_gitlab-access-token.png" alt="gitlab-access-token"></a>
```
export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### Run flux bootstrap
```
flux bootstrap gitlab \
  --owner=<gitlab-username> \
  --repository=fleet-infra \
  --branch=master \
  --path=clusters/cluster01 \
  --token-auth \
  --personal
```
The bootstrap command above does the following:
- Creates a git repository fleet-infra on your Gitlab account.
- Adds Flux component manifests to the repository.
- Deploys Flux Components to your Kubernetes Cluster.
- Configures Flux components to track the path /clusters/cluster01 in the repository.

### Clone the git repository
Clone the fleet-infra repository to your local machine:
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/fluxcd
cd ~/workspace/fluxcd
git clone git@gitlab.com:<username>/fleet-infra.git
cd fleet-infra
```

### Add podinfo repository to Flux
This example uses a public repository [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo), a tiny web application made with Go.
- Create a GitRepository manifest pointing to podinfo repository‚Äôs master branch:
```
flux create source git podinfo \
  --url=https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo \
  --branch=master \
  --interval=30s \
  --export > ./clusters/cluster01/podinfo-source.yaml
```

- Commit and push the `podinfo-source.yaml` file to the `fleet-infra` repository:
```
git add -A && git commit -m "Add podinfo GitRepository"
git push
```
- Check logs of pod source-controller, you will see:
```
{"level":"info","ts":"2023-07-04T10:29:55.043Z","msg":"stored artifact for commit 'Add podinfo GitRepository'","controller":"gitrepository","controllerGroup":"source.toolkit.fluxcd.io","controllerKind":"GitRepository","GitRepository":{"name":"flux-system","namespace":"flux-system"},"namespace":"flux-system","name":"flux-system","reconcileID":"3a127e3e-23e2-4035-91fb-914bd61bcb68"}

{"level":"info","ts":"2023-07-04T10:29:58.851Z","msg":"stored artifact for commit 'Merge pull request #274 from stefanprodan/alpine-3...'","controller":"gitrepository","controllerGroup":"source.toolkit.fluxcd.io","controllerKind":"GitRepository","GitRepository":{"name":"podinfo","namespace":"flux-system"},"namespace":"flux-system","name":"podinfo","reconcileID":"0af3d8ba-b00c-4999-be09-1ab249bb72c5"}
```
- In the source-controller, we will see:

<img src="resources/images/4_create_sources.png" alt="create_sources"></a>

### Deploy podinfo application
Configure Flux to build and apply the `kustomize` directory located in the podinfo repository.
- Use the `flux create` command to create a `Kustomization` that applies the podinfo deployment.
```
flux create kustomization podinfo \
  --target-namespace=default \
  --source=podinfo \
  --path="./kustomize" \
  --prune=true \
  --interval=5m \
  --export > ./clusters/cluster01/podinfo-kustomization.yaml
```
- Commit and push the Kustomization manifest to the repository:
```
git add -A && git commit -m "Add podinfo Kustomization"
git push
```

### Watch Flux sync the application 
- Use the flux get command to watch the podinfo app.
```
flux get kustomizations --watch
```
- The output is similar to:
```
NAME       	REVISION            	SUSPENDED	READY	MESSAGE                                
flux-system	master@sha1:0091085c	False    	True 	Applied revision: master@sha1:0091085c	
podinfo	    master@sha1:dd3869b1	False	    True	Applied revision: master@sha1:dd3869b1	
```

- Check podinfo has been deployed on your cluster:
```
kubectl -n default get deployments,services
```
- The output is similar to:
```
NAME                      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/podinfo   2/2     2            2           13m

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP             6h51m
service/podinfo      ClusterIP   10.104.232.239   <none>        9898/TCP,9999/TCP   13m
```

Changes made to the podinfo Kubernetes manifests in the master branch are reflected in your cluster.
- Kubernetes manifest is removed from the podinfo repository => Flux removes it from your cluster.
- Delete a Kustomization from the fleet-infra repository => Flux removes all Kubernetes objects previously applied from that Kustomization.
- Edit the podinfo deployment using kubectl edit, the changes are reverted to match the state described in Git.

### Suspend updates
- To suspend updates for a kustomization, run the command `flux suspend kustomization <name>`
- To resume updates run the command `flux resume kustomization <name>`

### Customize podinfo deployment
To customize a deployment from a repository you don‚Äôt control, you can use [Flux in-line patches](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#patches). Example:
- Add the following to the field spec of your podinfo-kustomization.yaml file:
```
  patches:
    - patch: |-
        apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
        kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
        metadata:
          name: podinfo
        spec:
          minReplicas: 3             
      target:
        name: podinfo
        kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
```
- Commit and push the podinfo-kustomization.yaml changes:
```
git add -A && git commit -m "Increase podinfo minimum replicas"
git push
```
- After the synchronization finishes, running kubectl get pods should display 3 pods.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ways of structuring your repositories
### Monorepo
In a monorepo approach you would store all your Kubernetes manifests in a single Git repository.

The various environments specific configs are all stored in the same branch (e.g. `main`).

Repository structure:
- Example structure:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production 
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production 
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ clusters
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
```
- Each cluster state is defined in a dedicated dir e.g. `clusters/production` where the specific apps and infrastructure overlays are referenced.
- The separation between apps and infrastructure makes it possible to define the order in which a cluster is reconciled, e.g. first the cluster addons and other Kubernetes controllers, then the applications.
- A complete example of this approach can be found at [flux2-kustomize-helm-example](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-kustomize-helm-example).

Delivery management:
- In trunk-based development, the changes are made in small batches and are merged into the main branch often.
- New app release can be automatically delivered to staging using Flux‚Äôs image updates to Git.
- For production, you may choose to manually approve app version bumps by configuring Flux to push the changes to a new branch from which you can create a pull request. You can limit the impact of an issue that escaped staging testing by using Flagger‚Äôs canary releases.
- Changes to infrastructure can be made in steps, first you merge a change to staging, when the cluster is successfully reconciled, and the new cluster state passes conformance tests, you then promote the change to production.

### Repo per environment
This approach is similar to the monorepo, with some notable differences:
- In the monorepo approach, all team members can read the production config since Git is not designed to restrict access to certain files in a repository. Having a separate repository for production means that you can grant access to a subset of team members while allowing everyone to clone staging and open pull requests.
- Promoting changes from one environment to another can be more time-consuming especially for infrastructure changes that can‚Äôt be automated with Flux image updates.

### Repo per team 
Assuming your organization has a dedicated platform admin team that provides Kubernetes as-a-service for other teams.

The platform admin team is responsible for:
- Setting up the staging and production environments.
- Maintains the cluster addon-ons and other cluster-wide resources (CRDs, controllers, admission webhooks, etc).
- Onboards the dev teams repositories using Flux‚Äôs `GitRepository` custom resources.
- Configures how the dev teams repositories are reconciled on each cluster using Flux‚Äôs `Kustomization` custom resources.

The dev teams are responsible for:
- Setting up the apps definitions (Kubernetes deployments, Helm releases).
- Configures how the apps are reconciled on each environment (Kustomize overlays, Helm values).
- Manages the apps promotion between environments using Flux‚Äôs automated image updates to Git.

Repository structure:
- Platform admin repository example (kustomize overlays):
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teams
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team1
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production 
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ clusters
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
```
- Dev team repository example (kustomize overlays):
```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production 
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
```
- A complete example of this approach can be found at [flux2-multi-tenancy](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2-multi-tenancy).

Delivery:
- The delivery process is similar to the monorepo one. 
- The main difference is the separation of concerns, the platform admin team handles the change management of the infrastructure, but delegates the apps delivery to the dev teams.

### Repo per app
It is common to use the same repository to store both the application source code and its deployment manifests.

Instead of duplicating the deployment manifests between the app repo and the cluster(s) config repo, the config repo can hold a pointer to the app manifests.

Inside the config repo you can define a `GitRepository` that tells Flux to clone the app repo inside the cluster, then with a `Kustomization`, you can tell Flux which directory holds the app manifests and how to patch them based on the target environment.

Another option is to bundle the app manifests into a Helm chart and publish it to a Helm repository. In the config repo you can define the `HelmRepository` and create an app `HelmRelease` for each target environment.

Repository structure:
- App repository plain Kubernetes manifests example:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ manifests
```
- Delivery example (stored in config repo):
```
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1

## üîé Glossary 
- OCI artifacts: OCI artifacts are any arbitrary files related to a software application. A common use case for OCI artifacts is Helm charts.
